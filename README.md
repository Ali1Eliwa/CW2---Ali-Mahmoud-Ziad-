## Embedded Systems Project Report: [Human Machine Interface (HMI) Project Design]

## 1. Introduction
This project is a Human Machine Interface (HMI) Alarm System built in Native C for the AVR ATmega328P microcontroller. Its primary function is to monitor a sensor value (simulated by a potentiometer) and display it on a 16x2 LCD. The user can set custom High and Low alarm limits using the keypad. If the sensor's value goes outside this defined range, the system activates an LED alarm and displays a "NOK" status on the screen. This README file serves as the main report, organizing all project deliverables and containing the relative file paths to all repository files, including source code, design documentation, and test cases.
